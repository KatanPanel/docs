Katan supports several types of platforms including Windows, Linux distributions, and can also be run using Docker.

## Multiplatform
Katan was developed with the focus on supporting as **many platforms as possible**.
There may be cases where certain Katan functions do not work or work incorrectly due to the platform.

If you have had any kind of problem, please, [send us an issue](https://github.com/KatanPanel/Katan/issues) on
GitHub.
