:::caution Disclaimer
This is a **very early and incomplete alpha release** of Katan. 
We are keeping this available to create a community and get feedback.
:::

## Features
Katan was developed with a primary focus on security, independence and performance.
Everyone can contribute to Katan and we have several features for that.

* **💡 Pluggable**: 
  * Anyone can create plugins for Katan and add new features to it, in addition to official plugins.
  * Plugins can also be made by the community, you download and use them, it's very simple.
* **🌍 Multi-language**: Katan has support for several languages that can be created even by the community.
* **🍃 Accessible**: Katan is free and open source, you don't have to pay anything to start using it.
* **🤓 Developer Friendly**: 
  * Developer API is simple and intuitive, create plugins for your panel or the community easily.
  * If you are just a developer who wants to use Katan quickly, the **CLI** is your best choice.
* **⚡ Blazing fast**:
  * Katan's initialization is absurd fast, in less than 10 seconds he is ready.
  * Katan can manage a huge number of servers on just one node.
* **🔒 Security in mind**:
  * This is one of the main focuses of Katan, we have cutting-edge cryptography and already known and reliable algorithms like Bcrypt, currently used by Katan and the native Argon2 that can be installed via a plugin, which is highly recommended.

## Why should we use Katan?
Katan was created with the intention of being simple, fast, modern and free.

Many server handling panels currently have various defects, so if you have a large game server network, automatically throw the idea of using these panels in the trash.
* **Poor support** for basic functionality;
* **Confusing configuration**, only you are unable to configure;
* **Terrible performance** and metrics;
* If you want something new, **pay for it**.

Katan is the motivation to have something simple that a simple person can use and configure correctly and without complications and to have something complex but that a developer can create and develop correctly and intuitively.

## Supported Games
Currently, there are not many games that we support so this is our current list of supported games:
* Minecraft – all versions.
