## Reporting Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities of any kind are our main concern and if found automatically it rises to the highest possible priority on our to-do list.

While discovering new vulnerabilities may be rare, we always recommend using the latest versions of Katan and their associated official libraries to ensure your environment remains as secure as possible.

To report a vulnerability, send an email to [security@katan.org](mailto:security@katan.org).
