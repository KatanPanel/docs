Before starting to use the Katan we need to understand how it is built.

Katan has several different applications containing modules that have synergy with each other.
The main application is *Backend*, everyone else needs it to perform their proper functions.

The other applications like UI are just **add-ons**.

### Backend
This is our server, this is where all the information is available, the *core*.
We can call it *Backend*, it is responsible for handling
of containers, accounts, positions and other things like plug-ins.

It is the meeting point for all other applications.

### CLI
The CLI is an active *Backend* module that makes it possible to interact with the *Backend* through
from a command line interface, typing `katan`.

You can create servers, view statistics, create accounts and do many other things.
If you are used to CLI you can use it so you don't need to install the *UI*.

### Web-server
While the *Backend* takes care of everything, the *web-server* takes this information and distributes 
it to whoever asks for it, is an HTTP and WebSocket server that transmits data from the 
*Backend* to other applications.

You can choose not to link it with the *Backend* to save resources.

### User Interface (UI) {#ui}
It's that site you saw on the Home Page, the client, where everything is beautiful and everything
works with the push of a button. It integrates directly with *Backend* and *Web-server*, we need
both for the *UI* to get information.

### Orchestrator
*Maestro* for the most intimate, is the orchestrator of the Katan, with which he will be able
to **scale** his servers, distribute them in different locations, but still keep them in sync.

It is thanks to him that you will not connect 100 servers on the same machine, ~~at least i hope
not~~.
If you are looking for **business-grade/hosting solutions**, this is the project you should keep an
eye on.
