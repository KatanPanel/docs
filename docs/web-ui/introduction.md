For non-CLI lovers, the UI has come to your rescue.

Web UI has been specially made to be extremely useful in cases where you need several different commands in the good old CLI to perform a simple action, now, it's all with the click of a button.

## Installation
The recommended and easiest way to install the Web UI is using
[Katan CLI](https://github.com/KatanPanel/katan-cli).

```shell
katan install web-ui
```
