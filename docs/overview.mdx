Welcome to the Katan documentation.<br/>
Here you can find the reference for all official projects associated with Katan.

## What's Katan?
Katan is a game server management panel built to run game servers in an isolated environment.
It was created with the aim of facilitating the creation of game servers quickly and effectively.

"Katan" originated from the combination of the first letter of the name of the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/), which is the main language of the Katan ecosystem, and the last letters of its creator's name "Natan".

## What can I use Katan for?
#### Just play with some friends
Katan is lightweight and fast. You there, you can quickly open a server whatever game you want to play with your friends, right on your computer.

Don't worry, your computer won't die, you can trust me.

#### Responsive scaling and deployment
Katan's versatile nature enables highly portable workloads. Choose the orchestrator of your choice and simply upload tens of thousands of game servers without any worries.

Katan's container-based platform also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down servers in real time.

See more in the [Scaling Up](./scaling-up) section.

#### Game server hosting as a service
Katan is [MIT-licensed](#licensing) and free of restrictions regarding services, you can safely use it any way you want if you want to use for example the Web UI so that your customers have an interface to interact with your game servers.

## Open source initiative
Katan is completely free and open source. All of its official associated projects are also open source and we plan to keep that.

We are immensely grateful to those who are already there and who are contributing to the growth and improvement of Katan.
